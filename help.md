This insight shows you the distribution of users based on their
overall activity. In this insight activity is measured by the number
of events the user has triggered over all time.

You can create **user segments** by clicking any of the colored areas
in the distribution chart. All your previously created segments are
listed in the sidebar on the left. **Selecting a segment** in the
list causes all insights to show information specific to that
segment.

When segments are selected this insight shows a separate chart for
each segment, letting you compare their proportions to the overall
distribution.

**Example:** Create segments for *Least active* and *Most active*
users by clicking on the leftmost and rightmost areas in the chart.
After the segments have been created, try how selecting them affects
other insights such as *Characterize* and *People*.
